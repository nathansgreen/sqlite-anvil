This copy of SQLite has been modified to use Anvil as its backend data store
instead of (or, for debugging, in addition to) its original B-tree-based
backend. Run its configure script with --with-anvil and provide the path to your
compiled Anvil tree. (Download Anvil with git; see the link below.)

It is based on SQLite 3.6.0, and the differences between the original and this
patched version can be calculated with "svn diff -r4".
